In this kernel, I will walk you through analyzing the dataset from the  University of Wisconsin, which has 569 instances (rows = samples) and 32 attributes (features = columns), building the model, and finally evaluating it. This project aims to train a classifier model on the cancer cells characteristics dataset to predict whether the cell is B = benign or M = malignant.
